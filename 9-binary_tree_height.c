/**
 * binary_tree_height - Measures the height of a binary tree
 * @tree: Pointer to the root node of the tree to measure
 *
 * Return: Height of the tree (number of edges on the longest path from the root)
 *         0 if the tree is NULL
 *
 * Description: This function calculates the height of a binary tree by recursively
 *              determining the height of its left and right subtrees, and returning
 *              the greater of the two heights, plus 1 for the current node.
